# Synonym-Networks-by-LLMs-and-Wordnet

This project compares synonym networks built using Mistral-7B (LLM) and WordNet (lexical database).  
We analyzed the structure, connectivity, and semantic clustering of both networks using a set of 240 adjectives.

## ðŸ§  Key Insights
- LLM network: 2,668 nodes, denser and highly interconnected.
- WordNet: 2,122 nodes, more segmented and semantically precise.
- Degree distribution, clustering, and subgraph examples included.

## ðŸ“„ Paper
The full technical report can be found in `/Paper`.

## ðŸ“‚ Code
The scripts to build, analyze, and visualize both networks are in `/Code`.

## ðŸ“Š Graph Outputs
Visualizations of degree distributions and semantic spread of example words like "heavy" are stored in `/Graphs`.
